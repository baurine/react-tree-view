# React TreeView with flat data structure

Instead of using nested data structure, for example, each tree view item data has a children property, we use the flat data structure, keep them same as in the database, each child item has a parentKey property points to its parent item data.

This project is generated by [Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) scaffold.
